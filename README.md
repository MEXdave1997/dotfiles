# My dotfiles

Can be installed via the `install.sh` script. The script will back up the old dotfiles. Use at your own risk.

## Acknowledgements

* Colours are from the excelent [gruvbox theme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
* `.compton.conf` stolen from [twily.info](http://twily.info/)

## Zsh config

I usually have the [grml zsh config](https://grml.org/zsh/) installed in /etc
which is why my .zshrc is rather short.
